As an adept technical writer and seasoned web developer, I excel in crafting comprehensive documentation and tutorial content. Leveraging my expertise, I curate technical materials using platforms such as Google Docs, Notion, and Markdown, ensuring clarity and accessibility for users. Additionally, my proficiency extends to documentation static site generator (SSG) tools like Docusaurus and Jekyll, with a track record of developing open-source documentation sites utilizing these platforms.
